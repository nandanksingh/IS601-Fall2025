# Module 2: Introduction to VSCode, Python, and Testing

## Module Overview
This module introduces students to integrated development environments (IDEs), specifically Visual Studio Code (VSCode), and how to set up a Python development environment. Students will learn to use Python with pytest for testing, create virtual environments, and understand basic Python programming concepts like functions and variables. By the end of this module, students will be able to set up a project using GIT and GitHub that includes a simple calculator application, with automated testing using GitHub Actions.

### Why VSCode, Python, and Testing?
VSCode is a powerful, open-source IDE that supports many programming languages and has numerous extensions to enhance development productivity. Python is a versatile programming language widely used in various fields, including web development, data science, and automation. Testing is crucial to ensure code reliability and maintainability, and pytest is a popular testing framework for Python. GitHub Actions allow automated workflows to build, test, and deploy code, integrating continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) practices.

### Learning Outcomes
- CLO 3 Create Python applications with automated testing.
- CLO 4 Set up GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration (CI), automating the execution of tests and Docker builds to demonstrate DevOps principles to ensure software quality
- CLO 5 Develop a command-line application using the REPL pattern.
