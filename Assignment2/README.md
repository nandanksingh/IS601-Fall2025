Assignment 2 – Python Calculator with Automated Testing & CI

Objective:

The objective of this assignment is to design and implement a basic calculator application in Python that demonstrates good programming practices and automated testing. The calculator supports the four fundamental arithmetic operations — addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division — and provides a simple REPL-style interface for performing calculations.
In addition to building the calculator, this assignment emphasizes the importance of software testing and automation in modern development workflows. You will create unit tests using pytest to verify correctness and configure GitHub Actions for continuous integration (CI). This ensures that every time code is pushed to the repository, all tests run automatically, enforcing 100% coverage and ensuring long-term project reliability.
By the end of this assignment, you will gain practical experience in:
•	Structuring a Python project in a professional format
•	Writing and running unit tests with pytest
•	Enforcing 100% automated test coverage
•	Using GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipelines
•	Running a Python application both locally and in automated workflows
