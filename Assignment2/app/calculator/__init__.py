# Explanation of __init__.py:
# In Python, a file named "__init__.py" is really important. It tells Python that the folder it's in 
# (in this case, "calculator") is a special kind of folder called a "package". 
# Think of a package like a toolbox with different tools inside.
#
# Without the "__init__.py" file, Python won't know that the folder can be used to group code together. 
# Itâ€™s like a flag that says, "Hey Python, this folder can be used to import code!"
#
# For example, with this "__init__.py", we can import the calculator function by writing:
#   from app.calculator import calculator
